# What the hell is this? 
*I usually make modpacks for different games I like to play, but end up modding and running servers for. Games like Minecraft, ARK and so on and since I'm playing a lot of Valheim I just felt it was about time to do something about it.*

I love modding. It's really fun to add things that expand the gameplay and to fix things I find could be handled better. Mods that help me sort things make me happy, as an example. I also dislike cheating. I never really been much for the "creative mode" part of any game. If you get everything handed to you, then where's the fun?

So I try to keep my modpacks as balanced as possible between making some parts easier while not taking away the work needed to advance in the game. Like the portals, perfect example. I would never just allow everything through the portals, it would make ships useless and make everything to easy. But... Allowing better portals to be built to let you take some extra thrue for each advance you make in the game? Perfect!

### So this modpack is my try at expanding the game
#### You get: 
* *More animals to fight and tame.*
* *More monsters to fight.*
* *More Magic to cast.*
* *More Bosses to find.*
* *A lot more things to build.*

#### You also get:
* *Better system for sorting all your things.*
* *Less need of filling torches and just enjoy placing a lot of them to light up your home.*
* *More boats.*
* *A different Health/Stamina/Magic system that I feel works better.*
* *Extra skills to advance in to make life just a little different.*
* *A different portal system that supports groups and guild (if ever that would be needed)*
* *Better riding and more riding as well as better handling of tames.*
* *An achievement system and statistics tracking*
* *A better inventory with special slots for armor and utilities.*

#### You don't get:
* *Unlimited resources at your fingertips*
* *Invincibility*
* *Flight*
* *Anything making the game not a challenge*

# What's been done?
#### These mods have been tested together and seem to work quite well together both in single player as in multiplayer, dedicated or not.  
I'm trying to keep the amount of mods around a 100.

Most mods that need it have had their configs fixed to work together as good as I've manage and I'm still doing some changes here and there, mostly for balance.  


# What haven't been done?
I have an idea of how some things should spawn, what some recipies should be like and if and how some stuff should be made available.

I'm also trying to keep the changes documented (for myself atm) and also trying to get a better guide for the mods made than the poorly written ones (if any) some of these have.  It will pop up on its own webpage as soon as I get the energy to actually finish one.
