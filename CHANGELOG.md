<b>V3.0.0

<small>Been a bit of changes to the modpack to fix some old mods not working and some mods that just needed to be removed.  
If you played with the v2 versions of this modpack, make sure the removed mods are mods you can live without!  
Or if you really need them, just add them yourself. The configs for them are left in the modpack just in case.</small>

    REMOVED MODS:
    * NoBuildDust by Azumatt (Removal doesn't affect old worlds/characters)
    * NoCreatureDust Azumatt (Removal doesn't affect old worlds/characters)
    * NoCultivatorDust Azumatt (Removal doesn't affect old worlds/characters)
    * NoHoeDust Azumatt (Removal doesn't affect old worlds/characters)
    * NoWeaponDust Azumatt (Removal doesn't affect old worlds/characters)
    * NoTreeDust Azumatt (Removal doesn't affect old worlds/characters)
    * ItemHopper MSchmoecker (Removal means hoppers built in worlds will disapear, but world will work)
    * Cooking Smoothbrain (Removal removes skill from character, no more unstackable foods)
    * Blacksmithing Smoothbrain (Removal removes skill from character)
    * Farming Smoothbrain (Removal removes skill from character, same kind of skill added to vanilla Valheim)
    * Soulcatcher_JC_KG_Additions by KGvalheim (Depricated)
    * Professions Smoothbrain (Removal removes skill from character)
    * WardIsLove Azumatt (Bugged out. Removal will remove Wards from this mod)

    * ZenItemStands by ZenDragon (It works nicely but I love how it make you not accidently drop things from stands)  
    * ReadMe By CookieMilk 
      (Write your own story, or novel, or just a diary? In the pack more for future use by me, but anyone can make a book. :)

<small>I'm going through the mods looking for errors and bugs but since I have very limited time nowadays I do like every help reporting bugs that I could get.  
As always, discord is a perfect place to let me know.  
  
I also still accept ingame images to add to the loading screen if you have any buildings or anything else you want to brag about. Just send me the images in discord and I'll add them to the next update for everyone to see and enjoy ;)</small>

---

V2.1.12

    INFO:
    There have been a lot of errors with shaders and a bunch of memory leaks and more.  
    Searching for what was wrong took ages since it's not just a matter of
    running one mod at a time since one mod working by itself still could screw up
    up together with another mod. Often it didn't make sense which one and the logs kept  
    complaining about mods that had nothing to do with these problems. 
    
    So basically it was A LOT of manual testing. It's not perfectly done yet but it should be
    a lot better now (I hope).

    IMPORTANT:  
    There is warnings in the log about memory leaks while running around Plains. 
    There is also a bunch of errors when near tamed animals.
    BOTH these errors are there even if you play vanilla so they are not caused by any mods  
    and to have them fixed we just have to wait for Valheim to get a new patch solving this.

    REMOVED:
    * Farming - Give strange errors that should have nothing to do with farming.
    * ResinGuard - Giving shader errors. Removed as part of fixing problems.
    * BoatAddition - Sorry. This is one of the mods giving most shader errors. Removed as part of fixing problems.
    * VNEI - This was actually never intended to be included in the modpack.
    * customtutorials - Never used it and was supposed to have been removed ages ago, but I messed that up.
    * PerfectPlacement - Removed and switched back to Gizmo (again). Seems it works if only on client.

    UPDADED:
    * Almanac will be updated to: 3.4.4
    * CookingAdditions will be updated to: 1.2.7
    * MorePins will be updated to: 420.0.8
    * WackyEpicMMOSystem will be updated to: 1.9.38
    * ZenSign will be updated to: 1.1.1

    CONFIGS:
    * AzuClock
      Since the update it needed setup to show time. Since the thought with the modpack is that players  
      shouldn't have to go through settings, this is now included. If you change it, just be aware it will  
      be reseted back to the modpacks config when updating.

---

V2.1.11

    UPDATED:
    * BoatAdditions v1.3.7
    * ZenSign v1.1.0
    
    ADDED:
    * Professions (well, readded since it's been updated and should work now)
    * Viking Sails
    * WardIsLove - To better be able to protect your things on a server.

    CONFIGS:
    * Fixed some configs being accidently included when not needed to.

---

V2.1.10

    UPDATED:
    * AzuAntiCheat v4.3.11
    * Jotunn v2.24.3
    * ResinGuard v1.2.5

---

V2.1.9

    UPDATED:
    * AzuClock v1.0.5
    * Build_Camera_Custom_Hammers_Edition v1.2.7
    * Logo_Changer v1.0.12
    * ZenRedecorate v1.0.9
    * ZenSign v1.0.15

---

V2.1.8

    REMOVED:  
    * Gizmo
      For some reason portals stop working when using Gizmo.  
      Strangest thing since this should have no effect on portals (it handle rotations).  
    
    ADDED:  
    * PerfectPlacement 1.2.2 by Azumatt
      Replaced Gizmo. Allows rotations around all axis, finer adjustments etc.  
      Not as straight forward as Gizmo but the only solution next to just skipping it all together.  
    
    CONFIGS:  
    * Moving building blocks, chests etc is changed from SHIFT to C.  
      So to move something placed wrong, instead of having to tear it down,  
      Hold the hamme, hold C and left-click on the object. This way you can move a chest with inventory intact.  
    * PerfectPlacement had really annoying keybindings. Most of which was used by other vanilla keybindings.  
      Now you rotate on different axis by holding SHIFT, CTRL or ALT and using scroll wheel.  
      You can enter "Advanced Building" by pressing F3 (you will see controls for that ingame to the left).  

---

V2.1.7

    UPDATED:
    * Gizmo will v1.15.0
    * More_Vanilla_Build_Prefabs v1.4.4
    * ZenRedecorate v1.0.8

    REMOVED:
    * Professions (UI problems)

---

V2.1.6

    UPDATED:
    * AzuCraftyBoxes v1.7.2
    * BoatAdditions v1.3.6
    * ClayBuildPieces v1.2.4
    * CookingAdditions v1.2.6
    * CoreWoodPieces v1.2.3
    * CrystalCollector v1.1.6
    * FeatherCollector v1.1.8
    * FineWoodBuildPieces v1.1.7
    * GlassPieces v1.2.4
    * GuckCollector v1.1.6
    * MagicPlugin v2.1.2
    * TarCollector v1.1.7
    * VikingsDoSwim v1.3.8
    * WieldEquipmentWhileSwimming v1.1.2
    
    CONFIG:
     Changed keybinds that had been reseted.
     P stores from inventory to chests again.

    INFO:
     I have one friend that tried logging in to the server after last update and his character was stuck,  
     his inventory was messed up, his view showed buttons for controllers and nothing worked.  
     He's the only one I know that experienced this problem and I can't replicate it. 
     PLEASE! If anyone else experience the same problems, joind my discord and upload your logfile
     so I can find a solution to this. It's really weird and as said, he's the only one, so far.

---

    REMOVED/QUICKFIX:
    * RichDiscordPresence
	  The mod worked perfectly but somehow it's not working with AzuAnti-Cheat.  
      It just refuses to be accepted. Joining server with this not in the list  
      of allowed mods doesn't work, which is fine, that's how it's supposed to be.
    
      But if added to the list of allowed mods, AzuAnti-Cheat starts complaining  
      about a mod not being allowd on the server and just randomly choose a mod  
      to complain about even though they all are on the allowed list.
    
    It's annoying but the only solution is to just not use RichDiscordPresence  
    since it's not essential to the game. But now I'm sad. ;(

---

V2.1.4

    UPDATED:
    * Expand_World_Size v1.25.0

    INFO:
    I'm working on a server for this, but first I need to see that it actually works. I mean, it works for me,
    but I need more people trying it out before I can start working on a server. 
    The good part is that most configs are done now in this modpack and should only need minor changes for a server.

  <summary>Old Changelogs</summary>
  
<b>V1.4.1 (Beta-ish)

Updated for latest version of Valheim, finally.

Please report any problems in my discord.  
I am sure there will be a bunch of bugs and need helpful people reporting them to find them all. :)

!!!MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR OLD WORLD BEFORE RUNNING THIS!!!

README
    This is a quite late and big update.  
    Either remove the old configs before running this one or 
    preferably, do a clean install of this version.

    Life came between me and the modpack which left it in a void for a long time  
    and I still haven't gotten the time to go through the configs as I'd like.  
    Sorry for that. 

    CHANGES NEEDED:
    There will most probably be a bunch of things needed to be changed in the configs,  
    specially when it come to spawning and drops. This is because a couple of mods have  
    changed their prefabs which I need to change in the configs as well.
    Luckily (I guess we can call it) these are not that many as it could have been since  
    I haven't had time to make all the changes I planned. But some are going to need to be  
    done and I will as soon as possible.

    BUT NOW...
    Try it out and make sure it works. I have tried it but it take so much time to accidently  
    do "that" which breaks the whole pack so ever little info or help in finding bugs is good help.

    REMOVED:
    * BetterNetworking 

    CONFIG CHANGES (Server)
    * Tombstones disapearing have been fixed, kinda. It's now set on a timer.
      Every time you die you have 30 days (real life time) to get your
      things back before the tombstone disappear. This to give you time but
      not forever because the world spawn would be filled with tombstones from 
      one-time logins dying a bunch of times and never coming back. 
      Every tombstone is locked so it can't be looted by other players so they
      need to be removed somehow. :)
    * Professions is having some overhaul. Atm it's only some nerf in sailing,
      nothing big. Max speed with boats at level 100 in sailinng i changed from
      50% increase to 30% increase. May have more nerfs and fixes in the future
      (changing it for each ship is the future plan since some mod-ships are to fast.)

<details>
  <summary>V1.3.41</summary>

    UPDATED:
    * WackysDatabase updated to v2.4.13

    CONFIG CHANGES:
	Fixed config for SleepSkip. I kinda missunderstood the config thinking
    that setting it to a minimum of 2 players would make it just be vanilla 
    sleeping when only one player was online. Instead it meant that if there
    was only one player online sleeping didn't work at all.
	
    New config means that when enough people sleeps a countdown of 15 sec start
    until everyone get to vote on sleeping or not no matter if they're in bed
    or not. This is only on the server.
    On the client it's a 3 sec countdown and then you sleep. No vote or anything.
    I figured noone that play this in singleplayer would like to have to wait
    15 second for a popup to show before they can sleep. ;)
	
    INFO:
    I'm still having a hard time getting the spawning changes to work.
	Seems like mobs I thought I managed to change the spawning on still
    spawn during days when set to only nights and so on. 
    Strange is that they spawn less, which means it actually affects the
    spawning so the settings still works kinda and that's even worse.
    Would have been better knowing I just screwed up the configs but now
    I'm not sure it's not just a prob with spawning behavior over all.

    I'm also just going to continue the screwed up versions since I already
    have it set now. 

    Config changes is going to be a lot easier than changing/updating mods
    so most changes during the week will be on the server and when I see
    that they work I'll implement them into the modpack. This way I don't
    have to do a modpack update each time I do a config change and have Some
    time trying them out since configs is serverside when on a server.

    AzuExtendedPlayerInventory because it's just plain better and more  
    supported by the other mods in this modpack.  
    
    To not lose your things in the extra slots on your character,  
    remove everything from your character, EVERYTHING, and put in a chest

    The problem this modpack got when mods changed, mods got split up  
    and other have driven me half-insane.  
      
    I'm not saying it's solved yet, but I found some of the mods that  
    didn't work well with others. So errors in log is down by 90%.  
      
    I will have to look into why Deer is getting worked up when players  
    get neer, but not scared enough to run away like they should.

    Remind me to never ever update a mod that's been rewritten, 
    split up or had any other major change.
    
    Hopefully these updates to the RtD mods will let players
    join the server again. 
    (Console error was "znet" and the updates says "Fixed double znet")

EXTRA INFO

    The next couple of days:  
    The modpack is updated to work with Ashland but isn't fully tested at the moment.  
    As of writing this I'm just going to upload it and then turn off my computer and  
    pack everything up and tomorrow morning I'm moving to a new apartment. 

    *OBS! I would advice anyone that already have this modpack to remove the folder with
    the mods before updating to this one. Othervise some mods might still be there breaking
    the modpack. If you don't want your skills and styff be reseted, don't remove the profile  
    but only the mods.*

    My internet ism't going to be installed in my new apartment until monday (earliest)  
    so the server is going to be down for a couple of days. The server isn't updated to  
    the latest version atm, I'm waiting with it until I've moved and had time to test  
    the modpack a bit more since it's quite a lot on it that I would like to keep. :P

    Configs:
    I've gone through the configs some more and changed a bit in some of them.  
    Most things shouldn't be noticable but I've done a lot of changes in how the world  
    load in stuff onto the map.  
    There should be no more spawned traps on the map and all the extra grass, mushrooms  
    and other "clutter" that's been added by different mods should be gone. I hated these  
    so for me personally it's better this way. They were more in the way than bringing anything  
    nice to the maps and the way modded clutter didn't fade in/out but just showed up/dissapeared  
    instantly looked awful, specially in biomes like The Plains.

    I've also made the extra trees be spawned in less than before. 

    All these changes to clutter and trees should make the maps better. Before this you could  
    hardly move without getting stuck on something and at the start you could barely build a  
    basic camp because all these mushrooms and trees needed a better axe to remove.

    FIXES:
    Been goin through the whole modpack during two days now trying to find what made the chat crash. 
    Guess what... Nothing!

    After spending forever checking the configs and then spending even longer adding each mod one at a 
    time to find out what could have broken the chat... It all works!? Like... No reason at all! 
    I haven't changed a thing and it just works. So now I'm pissed!
    Oh well...

SERVER
    * Changed the player cap on the server to 20 people. Will probably change it to 50 or something in the future. 
      Just not sure it works :p
    * Changed the map to 2x the size in diameter which in reality make the map four times bigger. 
      This is to see if it works ok and to actually make it not to crowded if there would be more players
      since, as mentioned above, the cap on server is set on 20 atm. 
    * Chatter was added last update which make the chat better for players to actually use (as long as the chat continues to work).

    * TargetPortal updated to v1.1.18
    * Gizmo will be to v1.9.1

FIXES
    * Finally found the frekkin skull traps spawning config. Fixed! No more of those ruin a world 
      (but you can still build and break your own). 
      It wasn't just one mod behind it but a really bad cooperation between RtDBiomes and Expand_World_Data.
    * Fixed some settings in ShutUp to only show errors now. 
    * Lessened the clutter and trees from different mods. Should be able to actually move around now. :P

    * CreatureAndLootControl

    SERVER & MODPACK  
    * It seems like the update changed quite much. It changed monsters/animals behaviors a bit, it switched out the engine 
      for a newer version and a lot more. This sadly made some mods crash. The ones that broke the game have been removed. 
      There is still some errors in the logfiles but atleast it seem to work now.
    * The server have had the mods removed as well and been tested. Some small error in a cfg-file can make it fail to 
      let you connect the first time, but second time you should be fine.
    * Both modpack and server will have mods added again when they've been updated. :)

    Since there isn't a good place to comment or anything on thunderstore (what I've seen) 
    I will add in the wiki-part if there is something going on with the server. 
    So if the server is down or something, check there. 
    I might be working on it and needed a restart.

    Getting error <code>"ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: $item_wolf_meat_cooked"
    but it can be ignored for now since it doesn't affekt the gameplay in any way. Had this since the start and 
    pretty sure which mod it is, and in that case it's a stupid misstake from the mod devs side.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.5</summary>

    Of course one or two mods just have to get updates right when I post the update!

    * Updated RtDBiomes and RtDMonsters to latest releases (frekkin like minutes ago).
    * Fixed the description... Maybe...
	
</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.4</summary>

    * Fixed a small setting I missed. Sorry. 
	
</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.2</summary>

    UPDATED:
    * Updated a bunch of mods (well, every mod that had an update).
    * Removed BowsBeforeHoes because it stopped working making arrows do no damage.
    * Removed StatsLogger because Almanac feels like enough.
    * Removed StartUpQuicker because it broke "something".
    * Removed Leach because it's really badly made. Can basically make any creatrure stuck.
    * CONFIG! Actually made some configuration changes. Amazing! :P
    * SERVER! Fixed the server. New world. Working and all. Just click the Fast Link at the menu to login 
      without needing any password. No whitelist but it demands a new character since the character is saved serverside. 
	
</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.1</summary>
  
    UPDATED:
    * Uppdated RtDMonsters and WackyEpicMMOSystem to latest versions. Yeah, that's it basically. Sorry. ;)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.0</summary>

    This is the first released version. Nothing in the configs have been tuned. Some might be to rewarding,  
    some to hard. All this fixed in later versions but it will take time since this is made on the side of  
    my "real" modpack for my whitelisted "friends only" server.
